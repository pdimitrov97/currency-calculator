## Description
This is a currency converter in HTML5, JavaScript and CSS suitable for smartphones. It allows the user to pick their home and visiting currencies. The currencies are limited to those provided by the ECB.
The calculator also includes a “Bank fee” option in case the bank charges for the conversion and adds that to the total amount.
The calculator takes the current exchange rates from ECB using AJAX and stores them locally so that the app can work offline. It also stores the selected currencies and fees for the next time the app is used.

## How to use it
All the source code has to be uploaded to a host that the phone can access. Then just simply load <b>currency-calculator.html</b>
